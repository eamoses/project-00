This is my first WDI project

Title: Racing Game

The objective of this game is for both players to each tap designated buttons on the keyboard which will propel their player forward. The first player to reach the finish line is declared the winner.

Technologies Used
* Terminal
  * bash
* Git
  * GitHub
* JavaScript
  * jQuery
* HTML5
* CSS3

Existing Features
* Objective button to learn how to play the game
* New Game button to re-play the game
* Two players
* One race track

Planned Features
* A round race track instead of a straight one
* Using bootstrap more to organize the items on the page instead of styling margins in CSS
* Using at least one constructor considering I'm not sure how to implement one right now without making the code unnecessarily long.
